This is a virtual capture card that displays a test pattern in lots of colorspaces, any resolution, and any frame rate. The bouncing text displays the colorspace in use, which moves diagnally 1 pixel each frame.

BaseClasses needed to compile this directshow test filter.

After its compiled, need to register the filter.

May register or unregister filter using GraphStudioNext for 32 bit, and GraphStudioNext64 for 64 bit.

Compile and register both 32 bit and 64 bit so this filter is visible to both 32 bit and 64 bit programs.
